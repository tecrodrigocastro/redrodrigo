# Me outside work

---
  
I practice physical exercises every day first thing in the morning, it helps me concentrate on my work. In addition to enjoying having an aesthetically beautiful body.  
I like to play some games that help me with motor coordination. 
I really like the Egyptian culture, I dream of visiting Egypt.
  
I mostly spend my free time working on my side projects and updating my knowledge on the topics of ancient cultures, fitness and computers.
